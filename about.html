      <h2>What is MyETHR?</h2>
      <p>
        My Expense to Hourly Ratio (MyETHR) is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you understand how long you need to work to afford something. 
        By factoring in your hourly wage and state taxes, it gives you a clear picture of the effort required to make a purchase.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Was It Created?</h2>
      <p>
        Built by an immigrant healthcare worker, MyETHR was designed to make budgeting relatable and accessible. 
        It is perfect for freelancers, students, and anyone who wants to make smarter financial decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Simply enter your expense, hourly wage, and state. MyETHR will calculate the number of hours you need to work to afford it, 
        taking into account average state income tax rates.
